It assembles researchers from all relevant disciplines in order to facilitate cross-fertilization and create new scheduling insights. The book comprises six major parts, each of which breaks down into smaller chapters: Part I introduces materials and notation, with tutorials on complexity theory and algorithms for the minimization of makespan, total completion time, dual objectives, maximum lateness, the number of late jobs, and total tardiness. Part II is devoted to classical scheduling problems. Part III explores scheduling models that originate in computer science, operations research, and management science. Part IV examines scheduling problems that arise in real-time systems, focusing on meeting hard deadline constraints while maximizing machine utilization. Part V discusses stochastic scheduling and queueing networks, highlighting jobs that are not deterministic. Part VI covers applications, discussing scheduling problems in airline, process, and transportation industries, as well as in hospitals and educational institutions.},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to develop models and methods that use complementary strengths of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming (CP) techniques to solve problems that are otherwise intractable if solved using either of the two methods. The class of problems considered in this paper have the characteristic that only a subset of the binary variables have non-zero objective function coefficients if modeled as an MILP. This class of problems is formulated as a hybrid MILP/CP model that involves some of the MILP constraints, a reduced set of the CP constraints, and equivalence relations between the MILP and the CP variables. An MILP/CP based decomposition method and an LP/CP-based branch-and-bound algorithm are proposed to solve these hybrid models. Both these algorithms rely on the same relaxed MILP and feasibility CP problems. An application example is considered in which the least-cost schedule has to be derived for processing a set of orders with release and due dates using a set of dissimilar parallel machines. It is shown that this problem can be modeled as an MILP, a CP, a combined MILP-CP OPL model (Van Hentenryck 1999), and a hybrid MILP/CP model. The computational performance of these models for several sets shows that the hybrid MILP/CP model can achieve two to three orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time.},

For this problem, a 2-approximation is known based on a novel convex programming (J. ACM 2001 by Skutella). It has been a long standing open problem if one can improve upon this 2-approximation (Open Problem 8 in J. of Sched. 1999 by Schuurman and Woeginger). We answer this question in the affirmative by giving a 1.8786-approximation. We achieve this via a surprisingly simple linear programming, but a novel rounding algorithm and analysis. A key ingredient of our algorithm is the use of random offsets sampled from non-uniform distributions. We also consider the preemptive version of the problem, i.e, R{\textbar}rij, pmtn{\textbar}ΣjwjCj. We again use the idea of sampling offsets from non-uniform distributions to give the first better than 2-approximation for this problem. This improvement also requires use of a configuration LP with variables for each job's complete schedules along with more careful analysis. For both non-preemptive and preemptive versions, we break the approximation barrier of 2 for the first time.},

With respect to the theory of robust optimization, this paper reviews recent results on the cases without and with recourse, i.e., the static and dynamic settings, as well as the connection with stochastic optimization and risk theory, the concept of distributionally robust optimization, and findings in robust nonlinear optimization. With respect to the practice of robust optimization, we consider a broad spectrum of applications, in particular inventory and logistics, finance, revenue management, but also queueing networks, machine learning, energy systems and the public good. Key developments in the period from 2007 to present include: (i) an extensive body of work on robust decision-making under uncertainty with uncertain distributions, i.e., "robustifying" stochastic optimization, (ii) a greater connection with decision sciences by linking uncertainty sets to risk theory, (iii) further results on nonlinear optimization and sequential decision-making and (iv) besides more work on established families of examples such as robust inventory and revenue management, the addition to the robust optimization literature of new application areas, especially energy systems and the public good. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We prove that for a general class of objective functions, the robust solutions amount to solving a certain deterministic parametric quadratic program. We first prove a general projection property for multivariate distributions with given means and covariances, which reduces our problem to optimizing a univariate mean-variance robust objective. This allows us to use known univariate results in the multidimensional setting, and to add new results in this direction. In particular, we characterize a general class of objective functions (the so-called one- or two-point support functions), for which the robust objective is reduced to a deterministic optimization problem in one variable. Finally, we adapt a result from Geoffrion (1967a) to reduce the main problem to a parametric quadratic program. In particular, our results are true for increasing concave utilities with convex or concave-convex derivatives. Closed-form solutions are obtained for special discontinuous criteria, motivated by bonus- and commission-based incentive schemes for portfolio management. We also investigate a multiproduct pricing application, which motivates extensions of our results for the case of nonnegative and decision-dependent returns. © 2007 INFORMS.},

In this paper, we propose a near-optimal algorithm for this general class of online problems under the assumptions of random order of arrival and some mild conditions on the size of the LP right-hand-side input. Specifically, our learning-based algorithm works by dynamically updating a threshold price vector at geometric time intervals, where the dual prices learned from the revealed columns in the previous period are used to determine the sequential decisions in the current period. Through dynamic learning, the competitiveness of our algorithm improves over the past study of the same problem. We also present a worst case example showing that the performance of our algorithm is near optimal.},

	abstract = {A hybrid Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)/Constraint Programming (CP) decomposition algorithm is proposed for the short-term scheduling of batch plants that rely on the State Task Network (STN) representation. The decisions about the type and number of tasks performed, as well as the assignment of units to tasks are made by the MILP master problem (MP). The CP subproblem checks the feasibility of a specific assignment and generates integer cuts for the master problem. A graph-theoretic preprocessing that determines time windows for the tasks and equipment units is also performed to enhance the performance of the algorithm. To exclude as many infeasible configurations as possible, three classes of integer cuts are generated. Various objective functions such as the minimization of assignment cost, the minimization of makespan for fixed demand and the maximization of profit for a fixed time horizon can be accommodated. Variable batch-sizes and durations, different storage policies, and resource constraints are taken into account. The proposed framework is very general and can be used for the solution of almost all batch scheduling problems. Numerical results show that for some classes of problems, the proposed algorithm can be two to three orders of magnitude faster than standalone MILP and CP models. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Project scheduling is concerned with single-item or small batch production where scarce resources have to be allocated to dependent activities over time. Applications can be found in diverse industries such as construction engineering, software development, etc. Also, project scheduling is increasingly important for make-to-order companies where the capacities have been cut down in order to meet lean management concepts. Likewise, project scheduling is very attractive for researchers, because the models in this area are rich and, hence, difficult to solve. For instance, the resource-constrained project scheduling problem contains the job shop scheduling problem as a special case. So far, no classification scheme exists which is compatible with what is commonly accepted in machine scheduling. Also, a variety of symbols are used by project scheduling researchers in order to denote one and the same subject. Hence, there is a gap between machine scheduling on the one hand and project scheduling on the other with respect to both, viz. a common notation and a classification scheme. As a matter of fact, in project scheduling, an ever growing number of papers is going to be published and it becomes more and more difficult for the scientific community to keep track of what is really new and relevant. One purpose of our paper is to close this gap. That is, we provide a classification scheme, i.e. a description of the resource environment, the activity characteristics, and the objective function, respectively, which is compatible with machine scheduling and which allows to classify the most important models dealt with so far. Also, we propose a unifying notation. The second purpose of this paper is to review some of the recent developments. More specifically, we review exact and heuristic algorithms for the single-mode and the multi-mode case, for the time-cost tradeoff problem, for problems with minimum and maximum time lags, for problems with other objectives than makespan minimization and, last but not least, for problems with stochastic activity durations. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using a specialized maximum flow procedure, the complexity reduces to O(tn3) operations when t is the number of distinct machine types. Previous algorithms solve the feasibility problem in O((m + log n)(m2n3 + n4)) operations. In addition to the feasibility problem, we describe algorithms for the maximum lateness criterion. Here we develop a bound which compares even more favorably to the best previous bound.

We begin with the model where the job due dates are affine-linear functions of their processing times and the job tardiness weights are proportional to their processing times. For this model, we classify the NP-hardness of the problem with respect to different affine-linear functions, and provide an O(nlogn) algorithm for each of the polynomially solvable problems. The second model we investigate is one where all job due dates have equal slacks, namely the SLK due-date model. Results for this model include: the problem is NP-hard in the ordinary sense; a pseudo-polynomial algorithm with time complexity O(n2P) is derived, where P is the sum of all of the processing times; and a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme is constructed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We present a branch-and-bound LP outer approximation algorithm for an MI-convex problem transformed to MI-conic form. The polyhedral relaxations are refined with \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}{\textasciicircum}*\$ cuts derived from conic certificates for continuous primal-dual conic subproblems. Under the assumption that all subproblems are well-posed, the algorithm detects infeasibility or unboundedness or returns an optimal solution in finite time. Using properties of the conic certificates, we show that the \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}{\textasciicircum}*\$ cuts imply certain practically-relevant guarantees about the quality of the polyhedral relaxations, and demonstrate how to maintain helpful guarantees when the LP solver uses a positive feasibility tolerance. We discuss how to disaggregate \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}{\textasciicircum}*\$ cuts in order to tighten the polyhedral relaxations and thereby improve the speed of convergence, and propose fast heuristic methods of obtaining useful \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}{\textasciicircum}*\$ cuts. Our new open source MI-conic solver Pajarito (http://github.com/JuliaOpt/Pajarito.jl) uses an external mixed-integer linear (MILP) solver to manage the search tree and an external continuous conic solver for subproblems. Benchmarking on a library of mixed-integer second-order cone (MISOCP) problems, we find that Pajarito greatly outperforms Bonmin (the leading open source alternative) and is competitive with CPLEX's specialized MISOCP algorithm. We demonstrate the robustness of Pajarito by solving diverse MI-conic problems involving mixtures of positive semidefinite, second-order, and exponential cones, and provide evidence for the practical value of our analyses and enhancements of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}{\textasciicircum}*\$ cuts.},

We also consider a dynamic problem variant in which deciding upon the speed is part of the scheduling problem and we are interested in the tradeoff between scheduling cost and speed-scaling cost, which is typically the energy consumption. We observe that the optimal order is independent of the energy consumption and that the problem can be reduced to the setting where the speed of the machine is fixed, and thus admits a PTAS. Furthermore, we provide an FPTAS for the NP-hard problem variant in which the machine can run only on a fixed number of discrete speeds. Finally, we show how our results can be used to obtain a{\textasciitilde}\$(2+{\textbackslash}eps)\$-approximation for scheduling preemptive jobs with release dates on multiple identical parallel machines.},

	abstract = {Praise for the First Edition "Finally, a book devoted to dynamic programming and written using the language of operations research (OR)! This beautiful book fills a gap in the libraries of OR specialists and practitioners." -Computing Reviews. This new edition showcases a focus on modeling and computation for complex classes of approximate dynamic programming problems. Understanding approximate dynamic programming (ADP) is vital in order to develop practical and high-quality solutions to complex industrial problems, particularly when those problems involve making decisions in the presence of uncertainty. Approximate Dynamic Programming, Second Edition uniquely integrates four distinct disciplines-Markov decision processes, mathematical programming, simulation, and statistics-to demonstrate how to successfully approach, model, and solve a wide range of real-life problems using ADP. The book continues to bridge the gap between computer science, simulation, and operations research and now adopts the notation and vocabulary of reinforcement learning as well as stochastic search and simulation optimization. The author outlines the essential algorithms that serve as a starting point in the design of practical solutions for real problems. The three curses of dimensionality that impact complex problems are introduced and detailed coverage of implementation challenges is provided. The Second Edition also features: • A new chapter describing four fundamental classes of policies for working with diverse stochastic optimization problems: myopic policies, look-ahead policies, policy function approximations, and policies based on value function approximations • A new chapter on policy search that brings together stochastic search and simulation optimization concepts and introduces a new class of optimal learning strategies • Updated coverage of the exploration exploitation problem in ADP, now including a recently developed method for doing active learning in the presence of a physical state, using the concept of the knowledge gradient • A new sequence of chapters describing statistical methods for approximating value functions, estimating the value of a fixed policy, and value function approximation while searching for optimal policies. The presented coverage of ADP emphasizes models and algorithms, focusing on related applications and computation while also discussing the theoretical side of the topic that explores proofs of convergence and rate of convergence. A related website features an ongoing discussion of the evolving fields of approximation dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, along with additional readings, software, and datasets. Requiring only a basic understanding of statistics and probability, Approximate Dynamic Programming, Second Edition is an excellent book for industrial engineering and operations research courses at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It also serves as a valuable reference for researchers and professionals who utilize dynamic programming, stochastic programming, and control theory to solve problems in their everyday work.},

	abstract = {A robust approach to solving linear optimization problems with uncertain data was proposed in the early 1970s and has recently been extensively studied and extended. Under this approach, we are willing to accept a suboptimal solution for the nominal values of the data in order to ensure that the solution remains feasible and near optimal when the data changes. A concern with such an approach is that it might be too conservative. In this paper, we propose an approach that attempts to make this trade-off more attractive; that is, we investigate ways to decrease what we call the price of robustness. In particular, we flexibly adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solutions in terms of probabilistic bounds of constraint violations. An attractive aspect of our method is that the new robust formulation is also a linear optimization problem. Thus we naturally extend our methods to discrete optimization problems in a tractable way. We report numerical results for a portfolio optimization problem, a knapsack problem, and a problem from the Net Lib library.},

For k = 1 and Ω = R +n we show that we can find tight upper bounds by solving n convex optimization problems when the set S is convex, and we provide a polynomial time algorithm when S and Ω are unions of convex sets, over which linear functions can be optimized efficiently.

Our framework begins by first affinely extending the set of primitive uncertainties to generate new linear decision rules of larger dimensions and is therefore more flexible. Next, we develop new piecewise-linear decision rules that allow a more flexible reformulation of the original problem. The reformulated problem will generally contain terms with expectations on the positive parts of the recourse variables. Finally, we convert the uncertain linear program into a deterministic convex program by constructing distributionally robust bounds on these expectations. These bounds are constructed by first using different pieces of information on the distribution of the underlying uncertainties to develop separate bounds and next integrating them into a combined bound that is better than each of the individual bounds. © 2010 INFORMS.},

	doi = {10.1287/opre.1110.0950},
	abstract = {In this paper we develop tight bounds on the expected values of several risk measures that are of interest to us. This work is motivated by the robust optimization models arising from portfolio selection problems. Indeed, the whole paper is centered around robust portfolio models and solutions. The basic setting is to find a portfolio that maximizes (respectively, minimizes) the expected utility (respectively, disutility) values in the midst of infinitely many possible ambiguous distributions of the investment returns fitting the given mean and variance estimations. First, we show that the single-stage portfolio selection problem within this framework, whenever the disutility function is in the form of lower partial moments (LPM), or conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), or value-at-risk (VaR), can be solved analytically. The results lead to the solutions for single-stage robust portfolio selection models. Furthermore, the results also lead to a multistage adjustable robust optimization (ARO) solution when the disutility function is the second-order LPM. Exploring beyond the confines of convex optimization, we also consider the so-called S-shaped value function, which plays a key role in the prospect theory of Kahneman and Tversky. The nonrobust version of the problem is shown to be NP-hard in general. However, we present an efficient procedure for solving the robust counterpart of the same portfolio selection problem. In this particular case, the consideration of the robustness actually helps to reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we consider the situation whereby we have some additional information about the chance that a quadratic function of the random distribution reaches a certain threshold. That information helps to further reduce the ambiguity in the robust model. We show that the robust optimization problem in that case can be solved by means of semidefinite programming (SDP), if no more than two additional chance inequalities are to be incorporated. © 2011 INFORMS.},

The adaptive distributionally robust optimization framework caters for dynamic decision making, where decisions adapt to the uncertain outcomes as they unfold in stages. For tractability considerations, we focus on a class of second-order conic (SOC) representable ambiguity set, though our results can easily be extended to more general conic representations. We show that the adaptive distributionally robust linear optimization problem can be formulated as a classical robust optimization problem. To obtain a tractable formulation, we approximate the adaptive distributionally robust optimization problem using linear decision rule (LDR) techniques. More interestingly, by incorporating the primary and auxiliary random variables of the lifted ambiguity set in the LDR approximation,we can significantly improve the solutions, and for a class of adaptive distributionally robust optimization problems, exact solutions can also be obtained. Using the new LDR approximation, we can transform the distributionally adaptive robust optimization problem to a classical robust optimization problem with an SOC representable uncertainty set. Finally, to demonstrate the potential for solving management decision problems, we develop an algebraic modeling package and illustrate how it can be used to facilitate modeling and obtain high-quality solutions for medical appointment scheduling and inventory management problems.},

Can we automate this challenging, tedious process, and learn the algorithms instead? In many real-world applications, it is typically the case that the same optimization problem is solved again and again on a regular basis, maintaining the same problem structure but differing in the data. This provides an opportunity for learning heuristic algorithms that exploit the structure of such recurring problems. In this paper, we propose a unique combination of reinforcement learning and graph embedding to address this challenge. The learned greedy policy behaves like a meta-algorithm that incrementally constructs a solution, and the action is determined by the output of a graph embedding network capturing the current state of the solution. We show that our framework can be applied to a diverse range of optimization problems over graphs, and learns effective algorithms for the Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Cut and Traveling Salesman problems.},

In contrast to previous work on distributionally robust optimization that focuses on certain parameters (e.g., mean, variance, etc.) of the input distribution, we exploit the historical data and define the accessible distribution set to contain only those distributions that make the observed data achieve a certain level of likelihood. Then we formulate the targeting problem as one of optimizing the expected value of the objective function under the worst-case distribution in that set. Our model avoids the over-conservativeness of some prior robust approaches by ruling out unrealistic distributions while maintaining robustness of the solution for any statistically likely outcomes. We present statistical analyses of our model using Bayesian statistics and empirical likelihood theory. Specifically, we prove the asymptotic behavior of our distribution set and establish the relationship between our model and other distributionally robust models. To test the performance of our model, we apply it to the newsvendor problem and the portfolio selection problem. The test results show that the solutions of our model indeed have desirable performance.},

We first show that a DRCCP can be reformulated as a conditional value-at-risk constrained optimization problem, and thus admits tight inner and outer approximations. We also show that a DRCCP of bounded feasible region is mixed integer representable by introducing big-M coefficients and additional binary variables. For a DRCCP with pure binary decision variables, by exploring the submodular structure, we show that it admits a big-M free formulation, which can be solved by a branch and cut algorithm.

Such chance constrained optimization problems involve the dual challenges of stochasticity and nonconvexity. In the setting of a finite distribution of the stochastic parameters, an optimization problem with linear chance constraints can be formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The natural MILP formulation has a weak relaxation bound and is quite difficult to solve. In this paper, we review some recent results on improving the relaxation bounds and constructing approximate solutions for MILP formulations of chance constraints. We also discuss a recently introduced bicriteria approximation algorithm for covering type chance constrained problems. This algorithm uses a relaxation to construct a solution whose (constraint violation) risk level may be larger than the pre-specified threshold, but is within a constant factor of it, and whose objective value is also within a constant factor of the true optimal value. Finally, we present some new results that improve on the bicriteria approximation factors in the finite scenario setting and shed light on the effect of strong relaxations on the approximation ratios.},

Most existing formulations assume that the probability distributions associated with the uncertainty are known a priori or can be estimated accurately from empirical data, and/or use separate chance constraints for upper and lower line/bus limits. In this paper, we propose a data driven distributionally robust chance constrained optimal power flow model (DRCC-OPF), which ensures that the worst-case probability of violating both the upper and lower limit of a line/bus capacity under a wide family of distributions is small. Assuming that we can estimate the first and second moments of the underlying distributions based on empirical data, we propose an exact reformulation of DRCC-OPF as a tractable convex program. The key theoretical result behind this reformulation is a second-order cone programming (SOCP) reformulation of a general two-sided distributionally robust chance constrained set by lifting the set to a higher dimensional space. Our numerical study shows that the proposed SOCP formulation can be solved efficiently and that the results of our model are quite robust.},

	abstract = {A joint chance constrained optimization problem involves multiple uncertain constraints, i.e., constraints with stochastic parameters, that are jointly required to be satisfied with probability exceeding a prespecified threshold. In a distributionally robust joint chance constrained optimization problem (DRCCP), the joint chance constraint is required to hold for all probability distributions of the stochastic parameters from a given ambiguity set. In this work, we consider DRCCPs involving convex nonlinear uncertain constraints and an ambiguity set specified by convex moment constraints. We investigate deterministic reformulations of such problems and conditions under which such deterministic reformulations are convex. In particular we show that a DRCCP can be reformulated as a convex program if one the following conditions hold: (i) there is a single uncertain constraint, (ii) the ambiguity set is defined by a single moment constraint, (iii) the ambiguity set is defined by linear moment constraints, and (iv) the uncertain and moment constraints are positively homogeneous with respect to uncertain parameters. We further show that if the decision variables are binary and the uncertain constraints are linear then a DRCCP can be reformulated as a deterministic mixed integer convex program. Finally, we present a numerical study to illustrate that the proposed mixed integer convex reformulation can be solved efficiently by existing solvers.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10107-019-01442-8},
	abstract = {A distributionally robust joint chance constraint involves a set of uncertain linear inequalities which can be violated up to a given probability threshold ϵ, over a given family of probability distributions of the uncertain parameters. A conservative approximation of a joint chance constraint, often referred to as a Bonferroni approximation, uses the union bound to approximate the joint chance constraint by a system of single chance constraints, one for each original uncertain constraint, for a fixed choice of violation probabilities of the single chance constraints such that their sum does not exceed ϵ. It has been shown that, under various settings, a distributionally robust single chance constraint admits a deterministic convex reformulation. Thus the Bonferroni approximation approach can be used to build convex approximations of distributionally robust joint chance constraints. In this paper we consider an optimized version of Bonferroni approximation where the violation probabilities of the individual single chance constraints are design variables rather than fixed a priori. We show that such an optimized Bonferroni approximation of a distributionally robust joint chance constraint is exact when the uncertainties are separable across the individual inequalities, i.e., each uncertain constraint involves a different set of uncertain parameters and corresponding distribution families. Unfortunately, the optimized Bonferroni approximation leads to NP-hard optimization problems even in settings where the usual Bonferroni approximation is tractable. When the distribution family is specified by moments or by marginal distributions, we derive various sufficient conditions under which the optimized Bonferroni approximation is convex and tractable. We also show that for moment based distribution families and binary decision variables, the optimized Bonferroni approximation can be reformulated as a mixed integer second-order conic set. Finally, we demonstrate how our results can be used to derive a convex reformulation of a distributionally robust joint chance constraint with a specific non-separable distribution family.},

	doi = {10.1287/opre.2019.1866},
	abstract = {A chance-constrained optimization problem involves constraints with random data that can be violated with probability bounded from above by a prespecified small risk parameter. Such constraints are used to model reliability requirements in a variety of application areas, such as finance, energy, service, and manufacturing. Except under very special conditions, chance-constrained problems are extremely difficult. There has been a great deal of elegant work on developing tractable approximations of chance constraints. Unfortunately, none of these approaches comes with a constant factor approximation guarantee. We show that such a guarantee is impossible by proving an inapproximability result. By contrast, for a large class of chance-constrained covering problems, we propose a bicriteria approximation scheme. Our scheme finds a solution whose violation probability may be larger than but is within a constant factor of the specified risk parameter and whose objective value is within a constant factor of the true optimal value. Key to our developments is the construction of a tractable convex relaxation of a chance-constrained problem and an appropriate scaling of a solution to this relaxation. We extend our approximation results to the setting in which the underlying distribution of the constraint data is not known. That is, we consider distributionally robust chance-constrained covering problems with convex moment and Wasserstein ambiguity sets and provide bicriteria approximation results.},

	abstract = {A chance constrained optimization problem over a finite distribution involves a set of scenario constraints from which a small subset can be violated. We consider the setting where all scenario constraints are mixed-integer convex. Existing works typically consider a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation of this problem by introducing binary variables to indicate which constraint systems are to be satisfied or violated. A variety of cutting plane approaches for this MINLP formulation have been developed. In this paper we consider a family of cuts in the original space rather than those in the extended space of the MINLP reformulation. These cuts, known as quantile cuts, can be viewed as a projection of the well known family of mixing inequalities for the MINLP reformulation onto the original problem space. We show that the closure of the infinite family of all quantile cuts has a finite description. An important corollary of this result is that for linear chance constrained problems the quantile closure is polyhedral. We further show that a recursive application of quantile closure operations recovers the convex hull of the nonconvex chance constrained set in the limit, and in the pure integer setting the convergence is finite. We show that separation of quantile cuts is in general NP-hard, develop a heuristic separation method, and demonstrate its effectiveness through a computational study. We also study an approximation of the quantile closure and propose a generalization by grouping scenarios.},

The state-of-the-art methods for solving the resulting distributionally robust optimization problems rely on global optimization techniques, which quickly become computationally excruciating. In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, the distributionally robust optimization problems over Wasserstein balls can in fact be reformulated as finite convex programs—in many interesting cases even as tractable linear programs. Leveraging recent measure concentration results, we also show that their solutions enjoy powerful finite-sample performance guarantees.

We introduce standardized ambiguity sets that contain all distributions with prescribed conic representable confidence sets and with mean values residing on an affine manifold. These ambiguity sets are highly expressive and encompass many ambiguity sets from the recent literature as special cases. They also allow us to characterize distributional families in terms of several classical and/or robust statistical indicators that have not yet been studied in the context of robust optimization. We determine conditions under which distributionally robust optimization problems based on our standardized ambiguity sets are computationally tractable.

In this paper, we study a modification to the SAA in the scenario where the global minimizer is either sparse or can be approximated by a sparse solution. By making use of a regularization penalty referred to as the folded concave penalty (FCP), we show that, if an FCP-regularized SAA formulation is solved locally, then the required number of samples can be significantly reduced in approximating the global solution of a convex SP: the sample size is only required to be poly-logarithmic in the number of dimensions. The efficacy of the FCP regularizer for nonconvex SPs is also discussed. As an immediate implication of our result, a flexible class of folded concave penalized sparse M-estimators in high-dimensional statistical learning may yield a sound performance even when the problem dimension cannot be upper-bounded by any polynomial function of the sample size.},

	abstract = {Consider the newsvendor model, but under the assumption that the underlying demand distribution is not known as part of the input. Instead, the only information available is a random, independent sample drawn from the demand distribution. This paper analyzes the sample average approximation (SAA) approach for the data-driven newsvendor problem. We obtain a new analytical bound on the probability that the relative regret of the SAA solution exceeds a threshold. This bound is significantly tighter than existing bounds, and it matches the empirical accuracy of the SAA solution observed in extensive computational experiments. This bound reveals that the demand distribution’s weighted mean spread affects the accuracy of the SAA heuristic.},

	abstract = {Lagrangian duality is a frequently used technique for solving specially structured linear programs or for solving linear programming relaxations of nonconvex discrete or continuous problems within a branch-and-bound approach. In such cases, subgradient optimization methods provide a valuable tool for obtaining quick solutions to the Lagrangian dual problem. However, little is known or available for directly obtaining primal solutions via such a dual optimization process without resorting to penalty functions, or tangential approximation schemes, or the solution of auxiliary primal systems. This paper presents a class of procedures to recover primal solutions directly from the information generated in the process of using pure or deflected subgradient optimization methods to solve such Lagrangian dual formulations. Our class of procedure is shown to subsume two existing schemes of this type that have been proposed in the context of pure subgradient approaches under restricted step size strategies.},

A simple condition for convergence is given and conditions that guarantee a linear convergence rate are also presented. We show that choosing the steplength parameter and convex combination of subgradients in a certain sense optimally is equivalent to solving a minimum norm quadratic programming problem. It is also shown that if the direction is restricted to be a convex combination of the current subgradient and the previous direction, then an optimal choice of stepsize and direction is equivalent to the Camerini—Fratta—Maffioli modification of the subgradient method.},
