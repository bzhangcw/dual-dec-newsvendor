  abstract     = {We develop a modular and tractable framework for solving an adaptive distributionally robust linear optimization problem, where we minimize the worst-case expected cost over an ambiguity set of probability distributions. The adaptive distributionally robust optimization framework caters for dynamic decision making, where decisions adapt to the uncertain outcomes as they unfold in stages. For tractability considerations, we focus on a class of second-order conic ({SOC}) representable ambiguity set, though our results can easily be extended to more general conic representations. We show that the adaptive distributionally robust linear optimization problem can be formulated as a classical robust optimization problem. To obtain a tractable formulation, we approximate the adaptive distributionally robust optimization problem using linear decision rule ({LDR}) techniques. More interestingly, by incorporating the primary and auxiliary random variables of the lifted ambiguity set in the {LDR} approximation,we can significantly improve the solutions, and for a class of adaptive distributionally robust optimization problems, exact solutions can also be obtained. Using the new {LDR} approximation, we can transform the distributionally adaptive robust optimization problem to a classical robust optimization problem with an {SOC} representable uncertainty set. Finally, to demonstrate the potential for solving management decision problems, we develop an algebraic modeling package and illustrate how it can be used to facilitate modeling and obtain high-quality solutions for medical appointment scheduling and inventory management problems.},

  abstract = {We propose a robust optimization approach to address a multiperiod inventory control problem under ambiguous demands,that is, only limited information of the demand distributions such as mean, support, and some measures of deviations. Our framework extends to correlated demands and is developed around a factor-based model, which has the ability to incorporate business factors as well as time-series forecast effects of trend, seasonality, and cyclic variations. We can obtain the parameters of the replenishment policies by solving a tractable deterministic optimization problem in the form of a second-order cone optimization problem (SOCP), with solution time; unlike dynamic programming approaches, it is polynomial and independent on parameters such as replenishment lead time, demand variability, and correlations. Theproposed truncated linear replenishment policy (TLRP), which is piecewise linear with respect to demand history, improves upon static and linear policies, and achieves objective values that are reasonably close to optimal. © 2010 INFORMS.},

  abstract = {We consider optimal decision-making problems in an uncertain environment. In particular, we consider the case in which the distribution of the input is unknown, yet there is some historical data drawn from the distribution. In this paper, we propose a new type of distributionally robust optimization model called the likelihood robust optimization (LRO) model for this class of problems. In contrast to previous work on distributionally robust optimization that focuses on certain parameters (e.g., mean, variance, etc.) of the input distribution, we exploit the historical data and define the accessible distribution set to contain only those distributions that make the observed data achieve a certain level of likelihood. Then we formulate the targeting problem as one of optimizing the expected value of the objective function under the worst-case distribution in that set. Our model avoids the over-conservativeness of some prior robust approaches by ruling out unrealistic distributions while maintaining robustness of the solution for any statistically likely outcomes. We present statistical analyses of our model using Bayesian statistics and empirical likelihood theory. Specifically, we prove the asymptotic behavior of our distribution set and establish the relationship between our model and other distributionally robust models. To test the performance of our model, we apply it to the newsvendor problem and the portfolio selection problem. The test results show that the solutions of our model indeed have desirable performance.},
